# Network-isolated policy — agents can use tools but have no internet access.
#
# Use this when agents need full tool access but must not reach
# external services, APIs, or the public internet:
#   - Sandbox is optional
#   - All tools except fetch_url are allowed
#   - Network deny-all with only DNS and event bus egress
#   - Useful for air-gapped or compliance-sensitive clusters
