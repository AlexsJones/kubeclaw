# Getting Started with Sympozium

This guide walks you through installing Sympozium, onboarding your first agent,
and setting up practical agent patterns for SRE, security, and DevOps workflows.

---

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster (Kind, minikube, EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.)
- `kubectl` configured and pointing at the cluster
- An LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, or a local Ollama instance)

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install AlexsJones/sympozium/sympozium
```

### Shell installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sympozium.com/install.sh | sh
```

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/alexsjones/sympozium/cmd/sympozium@latest
```

Verify the install:

```bash
sympozium version
```

---

## Deploy the control plane

Sympozium needs its CRDs, controller, NATS event bus, and webhook installed in
your cluster. The CLI handles this automatically during onboarding, or you can
do it manually:

```bash
sympozium install
```

This creates the `sympozium-system` namespace and deploys all components. It is
idempotent — safe to run again if something changes.

---

## Onboard your first agent

Sympozium offers two onboarding paths: an **interactive TUI wizard** (default)
and a **plain console fallback** for headless / CI environments.

### TUI wizard (recommended)

```bash
sympozium onboard
```

The wizard walks you through six steps:

| Step | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **1 — Cluster check** | Verifies the cluster is reachable and Sympozium is installed. Offers to run `sympozium install` if CRDs are missing. |
| **2 — Provider** | Choose your LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Enter a base URL if needed, then paste your API key. |
| **3 — Channel** | Optionally connect a messaging channel (Telegram, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp) or skip for now. |
| **4 — Policy** | Choose a policy preset: **Permissive** (everything allowed), **Default** (commands require approval), or **Restrictive** (very locked-down). |
| **5 — Heartbeat** | Pick how often the agent should wake up on its own: every 30 min, hourly (recommended), every 6 hours, daily at 9 AM, or disabled. |
| **6 — Confirm** | Review a summary of your choices and apply. |

The wizard creates:

- A **Kubernetes Secret** with your API key
- A **SympoziumInstance** custom resource (your agent identity)
- A **SympoziumPolicy** (tool-gating rules)
- A **SympoziumSchedule** heartbeat (unless you chose "disabled")

After onboarding you land in the TUI dashboard — your agent is live.

### Console fallback

If your terminal does not support the TUI (e.g. a plain SSH session or CI
pipeline), pass `--console`:

```bash
sympozium onboard --console
```

You will get the same six prompts as numbered menus in plain text.

---

## The TUI dashboard

Once onboarded, launch the dashboard:

```bash
sympozium
```

From the dashboard you can:

- **Send tasks** to your agent by typing a message and pressing Enter.
- **View runs** — see live status of current and past AgentRuns.
- **Edit an instance** — open the edit modal (press `e`) to change the
  heartbeat schedule, review memory, or toggle skills.
- **Switch instances** — if you have multiple SympoziumInstances.

---

## Running your first task

Type a message into the input bar:

```
List all pods that are not Running across every namespace.
```

Sympozium creates an **AgentRun** CR, spins up an ephemeral pod, calls your LLM,
and uses the built-in tools to fulfil the task. You will see the result stream
back in the TUI.

### Built-in tools

Every agent pod ships with these seven tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_command` | Run shell commands (kubectl, curl, jq…) in a skill sidecar |
| `read_file` | Read a file from the pod filesystem |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file |
| `list_directory` | List directory contents |
| `send_channel_message` | Send a message to Telegram / Slack / Discord / WhatsApp |
| `fetch_url` | HTTP GET a URL and return the body |
| `schedule_task` | Create, update, suspend, or delete SympoziumSchedule CRDs |

Tools are governed by the **SympoziumPolicy** you selected during onboarding. The
default policy lets read-only tools run freely and asks for approval before
`execute_command`.

---

## Agent patterns

Below are three practical agent personas you can set up. Each combines a
**SympoziumInstance**, one or more **SkillPacks**, and a tailored **heartbeat** to
create a purpose-built agent.

### 1. SRE On-Call Agent

An always-on agent that monitors cluster health, triages incidents, and can
perform rollbacks.

**Skills:** `k8s-ops`, `incident-response`

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: SympoziumInstance
metadata:
  name: sre-oncall
spec:
  agents:
    default:
      model: gpt-4o
  skills:
    - skillPackRef: k8s-ops
    - skillPackRef: incident-response
  policyRef: default-policy
```

**Heartbeat** — every 30 minutes:

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: SympoziumSchedule
metadata:
  name: sre-oncall-heartbeat
spec:
  instanceRef: sre-oncall
  schedule: "*/30 * * * *"
  type: heartbeat
  includeMemory: true
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  task: |
    Quick cluster health check:
    1. Are all nodes Ready?
    2. Any pods not Running?
    3. Any Warning events in the last 30 minutes?
    Summarise findings. If something looks wrong, triage it.
```

**Example tasks to try:**

```
Why is the checkout-service pod crash-looping in the production namespace?
```
```
Roll back the payments-api deployment to the previous version.
```
```
Show me the top 5 resource-hungry pods across the cluster.
```

The `k8s-ops` skill gives the agent kubectl access through a sidecar container
with scoped RBAC. The `incident-response` skill provides structured triage,
log analysis, and rollback runbooks so the agent follows a consistent process.

---

### 2. Security Auditor Agent

A periodic agent that reviews cluster configuration and scans code for
anti-patterns. Runs on a daily schedule.

**Skills:** `code-review` (includes security-patterns)

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: SympoziumInstance
metadata:
  name: security-auditor
spec:
  agents:
    default:
      model: gpt-4o
  skills:
    - skillPackRef: code-review
    - skillPackRef: k8s-ops
  policyRef: restrictive
```

**Heartbeat** — daily at 9 AM:

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: SympoziumSchedule
metadata:
  name: security-daily-scan
spec:
  instanceRef: security-auditor
  schedule: "0 9 * * *"
  type: scheduled
  includeMemory: true
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  task: |
    Daily security audit:
    1. Check for pods running as root (runAsNonRoot not set).
    2. Check for containers with privileged: true or ALL capabilities.
    3. Look for Secrets mounted as environment variables instead of volumes.
    4. Check that NetworkPolicies exist in all non-system namespaces.
    5. Report findings with severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low).
```

**Example tasks to try:**

```
Audit RBAC — which ServiceAccounts have cluster-admin?
```
```
Check if any deployments are using the :latest image tag.
```
```
Review the Helm values in the staging namespace for hardcoded secrets.
```

The `restrictive` policy ensures the agent cannot run arbitrary commands
without approval — the right guardrail for a security-focused agent.

---

### 3. DevOps / Platform Engineer Agent

A general-purpose agent for day-to-day cluster operations, deploys, and
troubleshooting. Runs with a permissive policy on development clusters.

**Skills:** `k8s-ops`, `code-review`

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: SympoziumInstance
metadata:
  name: devops
spec:
  agents:
    default:
      model: gpt-4o
  skills:
    - skillPackRef: k8s-ops
    - skillPackRef: code-review
  policyRef: permissive
```

**Heartbeat** — every hour:

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: SympoziumSchedule
metadata:
  name: devops-heartbeat
spec:
  instanceRef: devops
  schedule: "0 * * * *"
  type: heartbeat
  includeMemory: true
  concurrencyPolicy: Forbid
  task: |
    Check in: review any pending tasks in memory.
    Quick scan — any pods restarting or events firing?
```

**Example tasks to try:**

```
Scale the frontend deployment to 5 replicas in the staging namespace.
```
```
Create a new namespace called "feature-xyz" with a LimitRange and ResourceQuota.
```
```
Show me the rollout history for the api-gateway deployment and explain what
changed between revision 3 and 4.
```
```
Drain node worker-3 for maintenance, making sure no PDBs are violated.
```

With the `permissive` policy, this agent has free rein on a dev cluster — fast
iteration without approval gates.

## Built-in SkillPacks

Sympozium ships with three built-in SkillPacks. Enable them on any
SympoziumInstance:

| SkillPack | Category | What it includes |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **k8s-ops** | Kubernetes | Cluster overview, pod troubleshooting, resource management. Comes with a sidecar that has kubectl and cluster-scoped RBAC. |
| **incident-response** | SRE | Structured incident triage, log analysis, rollback procedures. |
| **code-review** | Development | Code review checklist, security anti-patterns, Go-specific review patterns. |

Apply them from the `config/skills/` directory:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/skills/
```

Or enable them through the TUI edit modal (press `e` on your instance, go to
the **Skills** tab).

---

## Channels

Connect your agent to a messaging platform so you can interact over chat:

| Channel | How to connect |
|---------|----------------|
| **Telegram** | Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), get the token, pass it during onboarding or set it in the SympoziumInstance channel config. |
| **Slack** | Create a Slack app with Socket Mode enabled, add the bot/app token during onboarding. |
| **Discord** | Create a Discord bot, grab the token, and connect it during onboarding. |
| **WhatsApp** | Use the WhatsApp Business API — Sympozium displays a QR code in the TUI for pairing. |

Channels are optional. You can always interact through the TUI or by creating
AgentRun CRs directly with kubectl.

---

## Policies at a glance

| Policy | Who it is for | Key rules |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Permissive** | Dev clusters, demos | All tools allowed, no approval needed, generous resource limits |
| **Default** | General use | `execute_command` requires approval, everything else allowed |
| **Restrictive** | Production, security | All tools denied by default, must be explicitly allowed, sandbox required |

---

## Heartbeat schedules

The heartbeat wakes your agent up periodically to check in — review memory,
scan the cluster, or run a standing task.

| Preset | Cron | Good for |
|--------|------|----------|
| Every 30 min | `*/30 * * * *` | Active incident monitoring, SRE on-call |
| Every hour | `0 * * * *` | General ops, default for most users |
| Every 6 hours | `0 */6 * * *` | Light-touch monitoring, cost-sensitive setups |
| Daily at 9 AM | `0 9 * * *` | Daily audits, reports, security scans |
| Disabled | — | On-demand only, no background activity |

You can change the heartbeat at any time through the TUI edit modal or by
editing the SympoziumSchedule CR directly:

```bash
kubectl edit sympoziumschedule <instance>-heartbeat
```

---

## Creating AgentRuns with kubectl

You do not need the TUI to run tasks. Create an AgentRun CR directly:

```yaml
apiVersion: sympozium.ai/v1alpha1
kind: AgentRun
metadata:
  name: quick-check
spec:
  instanceRef: devops
  task: "How many nodes are in the cluster and what are their roles?"
  model:
    name: gpt-4o
    provider: openai
  skills:
    - k8s-ops
  timeout: "5m"
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f quick-check.yaml
kubectl get agentrun quick-check -w   # watch status.phase
```

The phase transitions: `Pending` → `Running` → `Succeeded` (or `Failed`).
